[{"content":"I was doing some mentoring this past weekend and staff issues came up - as they always do.\nI asked about 1:1s and I realised that this person was being a manager, rather than a leader. We started talking and I thought I would share some of the insights that I got from our conversation.\n Rules were meant to be broken Do what works for you and your staff. Learn from them. Learn from yourself.\nTreat your staff the way you want to be treated Look at your best and worst experiences. Do more of the good and less of the bad. Be brutally honest with yourself. Was it a bad experience because it was a painful, but useful lesson, or was your manager just bad at their job?\n1:1s aren\u0026rsquo;t a nice to have - they are required, at least for you to offer them If you\u0026rsquo;re not having regular 1:1s with your staff, start as soon as you can. Expect the same of any people leaders reporting to you.\nSchedule enough time When I have a reasonable sized team I book a 30 min slot each fortnight (that\u0026rsquo;s every two weeks for our American friends!) with my staff. I then block out the next 30 minutes so they don\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed. Yes, that is 1 hour for each of your direct reports.\nMake time for people who aren\u0026rsquo;t your direct reports. Some people call them \u0026ldquo;Office hours\u0026rdquo;, whatever you call it, schedule the time and then make time for your people.\nThe times are sacrosanct. Don\u0026rsquo;t reschedule on your staff. This is one of the most important rules. You are making yourself available for your staff and showing them that they are important. Don\u0026rsquo;t accept conflicting meetings. Set this rule early and stick to it and your colleagues will understand. If your staff needs to reschedule, be as flexible as you can. Sometimes you will have to reschedule, apologies, explain and most of time time they will understand.\nThis is not a management meeting, this is their time Another important rule. If you are a people leader you should know on what your staff are working. 1:1s are NOT yet-another work meeting.\nThe 1:1 is for your staff to discuss what is important to them. I\u0026rsquo;ve had staff cry, I\u0026rsquo;ve had staff come out, discuss mental health issues, upcoming sports events, ask me what I thought about business strategy, discuss job offers from competitors. It\u0026rsquo;s all on the table. Don\u0026rsquo;t drive the meeting. Let your staff be comfortable. It might take some time, but trust them.\n1:1s are confidential What you discuss in the 1:1 is between you and the staff member. You have to work with this person for a third of your work week. They need to be able to vent about other people at work. You might listen. You might have coping strategies. You don\u0026rsquo;t, EVER, use this against them.\n1:1s are good for feedback As in the point above, as 1:1s are confidential, you can use them for constructive feedback. Help the person grow in their role. If you want to discuss something that wasn\u0026rsquo;t right, don\u0026rsquo;t blame. Discuss what you saw, how it impacted others and then try to get the person to discuss their actions. Talking objectively allows us to see our actions with a cool head.\nTake feedback Ask each of your staff if the format is working for them, and what they would change. I had one staff member that we went for a walk and a coffee, another just wanted to be in the office, get the meeting done and then back to the day. Some like meetings early in the day, some like them later. Some want shorter meetings (keep the full hour blocked - you might even get some time for yourself!). Work with them.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/1-1s-as-a-people-leader/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was doing some mentoring this past weekend and staff issues came up - as they\nalways do.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"1:1s as a people leader"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a fun observation.\nHow quickly can you find a number between \\(27/97\\) and \\(27/98\\)?\nWithout using a calculator?\n For any two rational numbers1 you can always find another rational number that lies between them by dividing the sum of their numerators by the sum of their denominators.\nHuh?

In interpreted languages, like python and R there is the concept of removing or deleting a variable or function.\nIn python you del variable, in R you rm(variable):\nfoo = 5 foo Naturally results in\n5 Now we delete the variable:\ndel foo # Delete foo foo # Traceback (most recent call last): # File \u0026#34;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; # NameError: name \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; is not defined Why does common lisp appear to make it more complicated? Why do we use makunbound and fmakunbound, etc., in common lisp?\n(The following is lightly rewritten and sourced from Peter Norvig\u0026rsquo;s Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming)\nâ€¦because common Lisp has at least seven name spaces. The two we think of most often are\n Functions and Macros Variables  Python, R, Scheme, etc. conflate these two name spaces, but Common Lisp keeps them separate, so that in a function application like (f) the function/macro name space is consulted for the value of f, but in (+ f), f is treated as a variable name.\nSpecial variables form a distinct name space from lexical variables So the f in (+ f) is treated as either a special or lexical variable, depending on if there is an applicable special declaration. Data types Even if f is defined as a function and/or a variable, it can also be defined as a data type with defstruct, deftype, or defclass. Labels for go statements within a tagbody Block names for return-from statements within a block Symbols inside a quoted expression are treated as constants, and thus form name space These symbols are often used as keys in user-defined tables, and in a sense each such table defines a new name space. One example is the tag name space, used by catch and throw. Another is the package name space.  Just because you can do something, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should  It is a good idea to limit each symbol to only one name space. Common Lisp will not be confused if a symbol is used in multiple ways, but the poor human reader probably will be.\n Peter Norvig, Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming   ðŸ¤£\nWhy do I like the lisp approach? It cuts down on errors.\nWhen collaborating it is easy to clash in your namespaces. You might define the variable two_pi, I might want to define two_pi as a function. My code runs, I merge it. Your code runs, you merge it. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have appropriate testingâ€¦ ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a contrived example, presented in three different programming languages: R, python and (common) lisp.\nHere I define a variable two_pi to be twice the value of \\( \\pi \\), then I define a function to calculate the circumference of a circle and then I define a function (also) called two_pi. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happensâ€¦\nIn R two_pi \u0026lt;- 2 * pi circumference \u0026lt;- function(r) { cat(\u0026#34;R: The circumference is \u0026#34;, (two_pi * r), \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;) } # We all know pi is actually 3 two_pi \u0026lt;- function() { return(6); } circumference(1) In this case R redefines what is meant by two_pi and the circumference function fails. Why? Because you need to call functions: two_pi()\nError in two_pi * r : non-numeric argument to binary operator In python import math two_pi = 2 * pi def circumference(r): print(f\u0026#34;python: The circumference is {two_pi * r}\u0026#34;) # We all know pi is actually 3 def two_pi(): return 6 circumference(1) Python also redefines what is meant by two_pi and the circumference function fails.\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \u0026#34;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; File \u0026#34;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, line 2, in circumference TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: \u0026#39;function\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;int\u0026#39; In lisp (setf two_pi (* 2 pi)) (defun circumference (r) (format t \u0026#34;cl: The circumference is ~a~\u0026amp;\u0026#34; (* two_pi r))) ;; We all know pi is actually only 3.

The design isn\u0026rsquo;t revolutionary.\nIt is just a group of static pages - thanks to the Hugo engine. The theme is PaperMod.\nI write all of my posts (and almost everything else) using Emacs. In particular I use Org Mode, and I\u0026rsquo;ve recently discovered the useful ox-hugo minor mode to export the pages for Hugo.\nMy plan is to replicate all of my other writings here. So you will see links/references to, amongst others, the Vifortech Solutions blog (see the Vifortech category).\nTesting locally I test locally, including looking at drafts with the following command:\nhugo server --buildDrafts --navigateToChanged If I\u0026rsquo;m feeling adventurous and want to test on another machine I\u0026rsquo;ll try something like\nhugo server --buildDrafts --navigateToChanged --baseURL http://$(uname -n) --bind 0.0.0.0 I\u0026rsquo;m faking the baseURL here to be my local hostname, so I can test on mobile for example. If my (or your) hostname doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve, the command ipconfig getifaddr en0 will give the local IP address.\nThis also opens up the site to everyone on the network, so probably not wise to do this on a public WiFi.\nExport the HTML for public consumption hugo --cleanDestinationDir Depending on how I\u0026rsquo;m working I\u0026rsquo;ll either use magit (by preference) in Emacs or just git on the command line to commit the changes and then push to the wider world.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/my-blog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is my blog.
