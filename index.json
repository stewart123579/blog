The design isn\u0026rsquo;t revolutionary.\nIt is just a group of static pages - thanks to the Hugo engine. The theme is PaperMod.\nI write all of my posts (and almost everything else) using Emacs. In particular I use Org Mode, and I\u0026rsquo;ve recently discovered the useful ox-hugo minor mode to export the pages for Hugo.\nTesting locally I test locally, including looking at drafts with the following command:\nhugo server --buildDrafts --navigateToChanged If I\u0026rsquo;m feeling adventurous and want to test on another machine I\u0026rsquo;ll try something like\nhugo server --buildDrafts --navigateToChanged --baseURL http://$(uname -n) --bind 0.0.0.0 I\u0026rsquo;m faking the baseURL here to be my local hostname, so I can test on mobile for example. If my (or your) hostname doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve, the command ipconfig getifaddr en0 will give the local IP address.\nThis also opens up the site to everyone on the network, so probably not wise to do this on a public WiFi.\nExport the HTML for public consumption hugo --cleanDestinationDir Depending on how I\u0026rsquo;m working I\u0026rsquo;ll either use magit (by preference) in Emacs or just git on the command line to commit the changes and then push to the wider world.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/my-blog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is my blog.
