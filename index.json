[{"content":"I wanted to count the number of pages tagged 100daysToOffload but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a simple solution.\nHere are a couple of options that work. We create a shortcode and in your org file pass the wanted tag to it in the variable tagname, like so:\n@@hugo:{{\u0026lt;tag-count tagname=\u0026#34;MyWantedTag\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}@@ The shortcode(s) Create a file layouts/shortcodes/tag-count.html and add the code below.\nPreferred approach My preferred approach is to use the existing .Site.Taxonomies variable:\n{{ len (.Site.Taxonomies.tags.Get (lower (.Get \u0026#34;tagname\u0026#34;))) }} What is happening here?\n (.Get \u0026quot;tagname\u0026quot;) Returns the value of the variable tagname; in the above example this would be MyWantedTag (lower ...) Converts the result to lower case. Note that tags are always lower case (.Site.Taxonomies.tags.Get ...) Gets the list of pages that are tagged with the wanted term len ... Returns the length of the list of tagged pages, i.e. the number of pages with the wanted tag  Alternative #1 - filter We can use the range function to loop over all of the tags and their values like this\u0026hellip;\n{{ range $key, $value := .Site.Taxonomies.tags }} {{ if in $key (.Get \u0026#34;tagname\u0026#34;) }} {{ len $value }} {{ end }} {{ end }} Alternative #2 - brute force The final option is based on this post where we loop over all the pages and increment a counter if we find a page with the right tag.\n\u0026lt;!-- (re)set the counter to 0 --\u0026gt; {{ $.Scratch.Set \u0026#34;tagCounter\u0026#34; 0 }} \u0026lt;!-- increment counter if post contains the wanted tag--\u0026gt; {{ range .Site.RegularPages }} {{ if in .Params.tags $tagname }} {{ $.Scratch.Add \u0026#34;tagCounter\u0026#34; 1 }} {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;!-- Return the result --\u0026gt; {{ $.Scratch.Get \u0026#34;tagCounter\u0026#34; }} ","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/counting-tagged-pages-in-hugo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI wanted to count the number of pages tagged \u003ccode\u003e100daysToOffload\u003c/code\u003e but couldn\u0026rsquo;t\nfind a simple solution.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Counting tagged pages in Hugo"},{"content":"Including beautifully rendered equations is easy in Org Mode.\nIt was as simple as surrounding the question by dollar signs: $\\psi (t)$ which appears on my screen as \\(\\psi(t)\\).\nYou can wrap them with \\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation} like\n\\begin{equation} i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left|\\psi (t)\\right\\rangle = \\hat{H} \\left|\\psi (t)\\right\\rangle \\end{equation} will produce\n\\begin{equation} i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left|\\psi (t)\\right\\rangle = \\hat{H} \\left|\\psi (t)\\right\\rangle \\end{equation}\n Previewing as you write RTFM to understand what is going on, but\n C-c C-x C-l (org-latex-preview) Produce a preview image of the LaTeX fragment at point and overlay it over the source code. If there is no fragment at point, process all fragments in the current entry\u0026mdash;between two headlines. When called with a single prefix argument, clear all images in the current entry. Two prefix arguments produce a preview image for all fragments in the buffer, while three of them clear all the images in that buffer.\n  Automatically displaying equations For standard Org documents (for example Org Roam notes) you should add #+startup: latexpreview at the start of the file.\nFor example, the following note for the Schrödinger equation has the command at line 5:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  :PROPERTIES: :ID: 1238BA43-EBAA-4D44-F54D-BEEF9E636548 :END: #+title: Schrödinger equation #+startup: latexpreview  \\begin{equation} i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left|\\psi (t)\\right\\rangle = \\hat{H} \\left|\\psi (t)\\right\\rangle \\end{equation}   For Hugo posts My Hugo posts are created converting org \\(\\to\\) markdown \\(\\to\\) HTML.

Often they do this though intimidation and fear of losing your job.\n There are many, many, many pages that Google has indexed about Inspiring Leaders, but what does that mean on a more personal level? I feel incredibly fortunate to have experienced a great leader in action. In my view a leader differs from a manager, by leading, not by checking boxes about how they should behave.\n You can tell you\u0026rsquo;re in a meeting with managers rather than leaders because they use words like I. It\u0026rsquo;s especially obvious in a meeting where they may be a manager and one worker presenting results to a broader audience.\nLeaders use I, but to praise. They use words like we when describing their work or, more likely, the name of the team member who did the good work.\n Managers constantly promote themselves to appear successful.\nLeaders are successful through the reflected success of their team - and through the praise their staff give to them.\n Managers promote (and protect) other managers. If you find one in the organisation, keep looking up the reporting line to find the root cause.\nLeaders spread their success - the person they aspire to is probably not even part of your organisation.\n I mentioned how fortunate I was experiencing true leadership. This person encouraged me and others, gave more recognition to us than was honestly due, never claimed our successes as their own and, perhaps most importantly, challenged us to grow and achieve more than we thought we could. Whilst I\u0026rsquo;ve not worked with them for a number of years I still think and talk about their impact and I try to replicate for those with whom I have the pleasure of working.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/leaders-versus-managers/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLeaders inspire you to follow; their actions make you aspire to be like them.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Leaders versus managers"},{"content":"Sometimes you just want to see the files that are being ignored by git.\ngit status --ignored  Of course, you could just RTFM.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/show-files-ignored-by-git/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSometimes you just want to see the files that are being ignored by \u003ca href=\"https://git-scm.com/\"\u003egit\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Show files ignored by git"},{"content":"Removing untracked files from the working tree is easy with git-clean\nI use this for removing intermediate (i.e. known, ignored) files:\ngit clean -Xf  -X Remove only files ignored by Git -f Force the removal   Of course, you could just RTFM.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/delete-files-not-being-tracked-by-git/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRemoving untracked files from the working tree is easy with \u003ccode\u003egit-clean\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Delete files not being tracked by git"},{"content":"Removing files you just added and committed to git is easy with git commit --amend\ngit rm --cached \u0026lt;yourfile\u0026gt; git commit --amend git push -f Taken from this answer on StackOverflow.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/commit-amend-remove-added/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRemoving files you just added and committed to git is easy with \u003ccode\u003egit commit --amend\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Amend git commits to remove added files"},{"content":"Surely Pretentious?
