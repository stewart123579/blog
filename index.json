Often they do this though intimidation and fear of losing your job.\n There are many, many, many pages that Google has indexed about Inspiring Leaders, but what does that mean on a more personal level? I feel incredibly fortunate to have experienced a great leader in action. In my view a leader differs from a manager, by leading, not by checking boxes about how they should behave.\n You can tell you\u0026rsquo;re in a meeting with managers rather than leaders because they use words like I. It\u0026rsquo;s especially obvious in a meeting where they may be a manager and one worker presenting results to a broader audience.\nLeaders use I, but to praise. They use words like we when describing their work or, more likely, the name of the team member who did the good work.\n Managers constantly promote themselves to appear successful.\nLeaders are successful through the reflected success of their team - and through the praise their staff give to them.\n Managers promote (and protect) other managers. If you find one in the organisation, keep looking up the reporting line to find the root cause.\nLeaders spread their success - the person they aspire to is probably not even part of your organisation.\n I mentioned how fortunate I was experiencing true leadership. This person encouraged me and others, gave more recognition to us than was honestly due, never claimed our successes as their own and, perhaps most importantly, challenged us to grow and achieve more than we thought we could. Whilst I\u0026rsquo;ve not worked with them for a number of years I still think and talk about their impact and I try to replicate for those with whom I have the pleasure of working.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/leaders-versus-managers/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLeaders inspire you to follow; their actions make you aspire to be like them.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Leaders versus managers"},{"content":"Sometimes you just want to see the files that are being ignored by git.\ngit status --ignored  Of course, you could just RTFM.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/show-files-ignored-by-git/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSometimes you just want to see the files that are being ignored by \u003ca href=\"https://git-scm.com/\"\u003egit\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Show files ignored by git"},{"content":"Removing untracked files from the working tree is easy with git-clean\nI use this for removing intermediate (i.e. known, ignored) files:\ngit clean -Xf  -X Remove only files ignored by Git -f Force the removal   Of course, you could just RTFM.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/delete-files-not-being-tracked-by-git/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRemoving untracked files from the working tree is easy with \u003ccode\u003egit-clean\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Delete files not being tracked by git"},{"content":"Removing files you just added and committed to git is easy with git commit --amend\ngit rm --cached \u0026lt;yourfile\u0026gt; git commit --amend git push -f Taken from this answer on StackOverflow.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/commit-amend-remove-added/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRemoving files you just added and committed to git is easy with \u003ccode\u003egit commit --amend\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Amend git commits to remove added files"},{"content":"Surely Pretentious?

If my (or your) hostname doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve, the command ipconfig getifaddr en0 will give the local IP address.\nThis also opens up the site to everyone on the network, so probably not wise to do this on a public WiFi.\nExport the HTML for public consumption hugo --cleanDestinationDir Depending on how I\u0026rsquo;m working I\u0026rsquo;ll either use magit (by preference) in Emacs or just git on the command line to commit the changes and then push to the wider world.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/my-blog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is my blog.
