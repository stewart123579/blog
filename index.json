So you might want to wrap this in (when (eq system-type 'darwin) ...).\nAside 1: Lexical binding is so powerful If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what lexical binding is, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend you read about it. Here we define the variable default-directory, but this value only exists within this binding (i.e. calling normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path). Any value that existed prior to this command still remains outside of this construct.\nWhat this means is that we can set variables for specific cases, without worrying if they exist elsewhere, trying to remember to set them to the previous values after we do something, or anything like that. Powerful stuff.\nAside 2: Repeatedly adding the same directory? If you do something like this in your shell (bash/zsh/\u0026hellip;)\nexport PATH=/my/new/path:$PATH # something export PATH=/my/new/path:$PATH you will get two copies of /my/new/path in your path. From painful experience this can get out-of-hand when you start shells within other shells\u0026hellip;\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem with normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path, only new directories get added. You can prove this to yourself by running the command above a couple of times and then looking at the value of load-path.\nOr\u0026hellip;you can see this by looking at the code.\nStart with describe-function (C-h f) on normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path and then see that it calls normal-top-level-add-to-load-path which (C-h f again) which does the uniqueness check.\nAgain, another reason why being able to dig right into what Emacs is doing is a superpower.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/emacs/emacs-site-lisp-fix-for-macos/","summary":"Emacs For MacOS (installed via Homebrew) doesn\u0026rsquo;t use /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp.

Make the centre column width adaptive to my window size Configure Emacs to open EPUBs visual-fill-column I like the option of distraction free reading and writing. That means sometimes, I want to have my text centred on my screen, but, also not taking up the full width (especially on a wide-screen monitor). I guess I could resize my window (frame in Emacs parlance), but the computer should do the work for me.\nSo I use visual-fill-column:\nThe primary purpose of visual-fill-column-mode is to wrap text at fill-column in buffers that use visual-line-mode.\nCentering the text - Another use case for visual-fill-column is to centre the text in a window. This effect is achieved by setting the user option visual-fill-column-center-text. Note that visual-fill-column-mode is not dependent on visual-line-mode, so it can be used to centre text in buffers that use auto-fill-mode or in programming modes.\nI simply added this to my setup:\n(use-package visual-fill-column) Adaptive centre column width I didn\u0026rsquo;t just want to have my centre column being defined by fill-column (the column beyond which automatic line-wrapping should happen), I wanted it to be adaptive. I want a comfortable centre column, wider for wide screens, but not too wide. How\u0026rsquo;s that for a hand-waving definition?\nSo I came up with my-centre-width - it calculates what the fill-column size should be for \u0026ldquo;comfortable\u0026rdquo; centring.\nFor small windows (window-width \u0026lt;= 1.1 * fill-column) we simply return 90% of the fill-column; for larger windows we get the maximum of either half the current window-width or the fill-column. The max is there for something like fill-column being 100, and window-width being 120 - in that case the result would be 100 (fill-column), rather than 60 (half window-width).\n(defun my-centre-width () \u0026#34;Return a fill column that makes centring pleasant regardless of screen size\u0026#34; (let ((window-width (window-width))) (floor (if (\u0026lt;= window-width (* 1.1 fill-column)) (* 0.9 window-width) (max (/ window-width 2) fill-column))))) As an aside: Don\u0026rsquo;t you just love that name spaces in (Common/Emacs) Lisp allow the function window-width to co-exist with the variable window-width!\nnov.el nov.el provides a major mode for reading EPUB documents.\nFollowing the README I\u0026rsquo;ve come up with the following variation\u0026hellip;\n(use-package nov :init (defun my-nov-font-setup () (face-remap-add-relative \u0026#39;variable-pitch :family \u0026#34;Liberation Serif\u0026#34; :height 1.3) (setq fill-column (my-centre-width) nov-text-width (- fill-column 2) visual-fill-column-center-text t)) :hook ((nov-mode . my-nov-font-setup) (nov-mode . visual-line-mode) (nov-mode . visual-fill-column-mode))) (add-to-list \u0026#39;auto-mode-alist \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;\\\\.epub\\\\\u0026#39;\u0026#34; . nov-mode)) What I\u0026rsquo;ve done here is specified that I want the Liberation font.

We didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily agree with the additional references, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t change the nature of the work, so we make the changes, resubmitted and the paper was published.\nHowever, I wanted the process to be smoother. I was researching in a new field, apart from the team at the CSSM there were only a few other researchers worldwide and we knew them all. It was a fairly safe bet that my reviewer was someone I knew.\nThe How: How I did it So I built a model to try to identify which of the researchers in my suspect pool were most likely the author of the review.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a similar solution to how researchers have used machine learning to identify how much of a Shakespeare play was written by someone else. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use any of the more modern techniques, I based my approach on email spam detection.\nI wrote (in C) a spam detector (which I subsequently used for years successfully on my incoming mail) and then trained it on a corpus of email. For each suspected reviewer I (effectively) flagged their email as spam and everything else as ham (i.e. not-spam). There was a wrinkle that emails from physicists usually use different terminology than emails from the rest of your correspondents (how many people use renormalisation, or Gedanken experiment in their daily messages?) - so I trained on mostly physics-type messages, rather than everything.\nSo now I had X detection models - one for each potential reviewer - and so I simply applied them to the anonymous feedback from the reviewer. These models looked at the common phrases and word usage of the various authors.\nThe result was compelling. One potential author was flagged, the others weren\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe Action: How I used the result Building a machine learning model can be fun, but\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026rsquo;s really not much point unless you put it to use. How did I do that?\nI used it to build relationships. I knew who was likely to be a reviewer of my work (and perhaps my PhD when it was finished). So the next conference I was at, I made sure to buy this person some drinks, get to know them, talk about my work and theirs.\nI think this made me a better physicist as I understood more of other people\u0026rsquo;s work and was able to extend my own.

This post is heavily motivated by the magicl dot product code and it appears in the following categories: code AI / ML in common lisp \u0026mdash; Implementing AI and Machine Learning tools in common lisp.\nInitial setup As we did previously, let\u0026rsquo;s create two lists, each being 10 million random numbers between 0 and 1.\n(defun randvect (length) \u0026#34;A simple list (length LENTH) of random numbers [0,1)\u0026#34; (loop for i below length collect (random 1.0))) (defvar n 10000000 \u0026#34;The length of our test data\u0026#34;) (defvar a (randvect n) \u0026#34;A list, length N, of random numbers\u0026#34;) (defvar b (randvect n) \u0026#34;Another list, length N, of random numbers\u0026#34;) Thinking about how we should store our data lists versus arrays lists aren\u0026rsquo;t ideal for storing vectors, lookup speed grows with length, whilst arrays have a constant time. This is important when building models, where the list/array might be 10 million (or more) observations of our experiment (defparameter array-a (make-array (list (length a)) :initial-contents a)) (defparameter array-b (make-array (list (length b)) :initial-contents b)) Previous version of the code This is the code I had for naïve-dot-v2 (which I\u0026rsquo;m calling v1 here)\n(loop for i below (length array-a) sum (* (aref array-a i) (aref array-b i))) v1 - 270.0504ms Let\u0026rsquo;s turn this into a function so we can optimise it\u0026hellip;\n(defun dot-v2 (array1 array2) (loop for i below (length array1) sum (* (aref array1 i) (aref array2 i)))) v2 - 234.21423ms Adding a check Before we optimise the code, we should add a check to make sure the arrays are the same size:\n(defun dot-v3 (array1 array2) (let ((size1 (length array1)) (size2 (length array2))) (assert (cl:= size1 size2)) (loop for i below size1 sum (* (aref array1 i) (aref array2 i))))) v3 - 220.24509ms I\u0026rsquo;ve created two new variables size1 and size2 and assert that they are equal.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not really sure why this was faster, it was probably a function of whatever else was (or wasn\u0026rsquo;t) running on my machine at the time, but it\u0026rsquo;s not really material.\nI want speed! Let\u0026rsquo;s be clear - we want to optimise for SPEED, so be explicit in line 2.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (defun dot-v4 (array1 array2) (declare (optimize speed)) (let ((size1 (length array1)) (size2 (length array2))) (assert (cl:= size1 size2)) (loop for i below size1 sum (* (aref array1 i) (aref array2 i))))) v4 - 222.48372ms No improvement!\nWhy?

Let\u0026rsquo;s remove the optimise command and add some type hints.\nAdding data type information Now let\u0026rsquo;s use lisp\u0026rsquo;s gradual typing features. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to write about this in another post (and I\u0026rsquo;ll update this one to point to it).\ndata type Python and R are making assumptions on the data we\u0026rsquo;re storing, they\u0026rsquo;re both assuming floating point numbers. How do I this in lisp? Easily. We just add :element-type 'single-float to the make-array command. This is exactly comparable to the dtype=float32 flag you\u0026rsquo;d use in python\u0026rsquo;s NumPy/TensorFlow/etc.\n(defparameter array-a-v2 (make-array (list (length a)) :initial-contents a :element-type \u0026#39;single-float)) (defparameter array-b-v2 (make-array (list (length b)) :initial-contents b :element-type \u0026#39;single-float)) Gradual typing is where we can define the type of data in a particular function - but we don\u0026rsquo;t have to everywhere. (Most) Other languages have an all-or-nothing approach, but lisp allows you to choose.\nBelow, in line 2, we simply declare that the type of the inputs array1 and array2 are simple-array single-float (*), which means:\nsimple-array just take this as it reads - a simple array - or dig into the CLHS for details single-float elements are floating point numbers (as opposed to, say double precision or complex numbers) (*) indicates this is a single dimensional array, i.e. vector, of unknown size 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (defun dot-v5 (array1 array2) (declare (type (simple-array single-float (*)) array1 array2)) (let ((size1 (length array1)) (size2 (length array2))) (assert (cl:= size1 size2)) (loop for i below size1 sum (* (aref array1 i) (aref array2 i))))) v5 - 120.991104ms We\u0026rsquo;ve almost halved the run time - because the multiplication on line 7 now can be simplified to only handle single-float arguments rather than a generic operation that works for integers, single and double floats, ratios, complex numbers, \u0026hellip;\nAdding type information to the loop: the accumulator We have now optimised our multiplication to work for out single-float arguments, but the accumulator (i.e. the sum part) in the loop function doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the type of it\u0026rsquo;s arguments. However, we do. The sum of two values of type single-float is another single-float. In line 7 we use that information:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (defun dot-v6 (array1 array2) (declare (type (simple-array single-float (*)) array1 array2)) (let ((size1 (length array1)) (size2 (length array2))) (assert (cl:= size1 size2)) (loop for i below size1 with s of-type single-float = 0.0 do (incf s (* (aref array1 i) (aref array2 i))) finally (return s)))) We\u0026rsquo;ve also had to add lines 8 and 9 to replicate what the sum keyword is providing in the loop.\nThe results were staggering when I first saw them.\nv6 - 11.116839ms We took an order of magnitude off the run-time and are now in the realms of the NumPy - hand tuned, optimised and mostly unreadable, C.\nOptimise for speed, again Again, let\u0026rsquo;s be explicit that we want SPEED.\n(defun dot-v7 (array1 array2) (declare (optimize speed) (type (simple-array single-float (*)) array1 array2)) (let ((size1 (length array1)) (size2 (length array2))) (assert (cl:= size1 size2)) (loop for i below size1 with s of-type single-float = 0.0 do (incf s (* (aref array1 i) (aref array2 i))) finally (return s)))) The lisp implementation I\u0026rsquo;m using (SBCL) is already a high performance Common Lisp compiler, so there\u0026rsquo;s not much to be squeezed out here.\nv7 - 10.600901ms Adding type information to the loop: array index We can help the compiler out a little more by letting it know that the loop variable i is for indexing arrays:\n(defun dot-v8 (array1 array2) (declare (optimize speed) (type (simple-array single-float (*)) array1 array2)) (let ((size1 (length array1)) (size2 (length array2))) (assert (cl:= size1 size2)) (loop for i of-type alexandria:array-index below size1 with s of-type single-float = 0.0 do (incf s (* (aref array1 i) (aref array2 i))) finally (return s)))) With this we can squeeze out a little more speed, but to be honest this result fluctuated depending on what else my computer was doing.\nv8 - 10.57616ms Almost the end At this point I would look into defgeneric where I can define multiple dot functions each optimised for different inputs, so double-float, complex-float, etc. This is similar to overloading in other languages. However, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that for another day.\nNow, if this was a language benchmark post, I\u0026rsquo;d stop here. However, I want to use this dot function in a practical use case.

I\u0026rsquo;ll look at python, R and common lisp and in each case implement the dot product myself as well as using an optimised package for the library. The fastest implementation may surprise you.\nThis is not a post on benchmarking, the timings in the final section aren\u0026rsquo;t taken on a particularly powerful machine1 or intended to be rigorous; the timings are simply to show that rapid prototyping, followed by optimising what matters can be worthwhile. It was, however motivated by my question on Reddit.\nThis post appears in the following categories: code AI / ML in common lisp \u0026mdash; Implementing AI and Machine Learning tools in common lisp.\nLisp versus X \u0026mdash; A different perspective is always valuable. What\u0026rsquo;s a dot product and why do I care? A dot product between two vectors \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be thought of as the sum of the product of the elements, i.e.\n\\begin{align} A \\cdot B \u0026amp;=\t\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\\,b_{i} \\\\ \u0026amp;= a_{1}\\,b_{1} + a_{2}\\,b_{2} + \\ldots \\end{align}\nSo why do I (or should you) care? Dot products are pretty fundamental to machine learning - as I\u0026rsquo;ll show in some upcoming posts. That means, when you have lots of data, you\u0026rsquo;re doing this operation lots of times. So how well your language implements this matters.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at two common (and one not so common2) languages and timings.\nA python implementation Python is the go-to language for machine-learning practitioners currently. There are many extremely powerful frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow among others. They are primarily built upon NumPy. If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this post, you probably know all of this.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s set up our random vectors\u0026hellip;\nimport time import numpy as np # How big do we want the vector to be? 10 million! n = 10000000 # Make two arrays of 10 million random numbers a = np.random.rand(n) b = np.random.rand(n) Naïve loop If we were to evaluate the dot product with a loop over each of the elements it would look something like\ndef dot_prod_loop(): n = len(a) tic = time.time() c = 0 for i in range(n): c += a[i] * b[i] toc = time.time() print(f\u0026#34;Python: loop version: {1000*(toc-tic):.3f}ms\u0026#34;) # Run it dot_prod_loop() Python: loop version: 3632.499ms NumPy Naturally, we can do better by using the NumPy implementation:\ndef dot_prod_numpy(): tic = time.time() c = np.dot(a,b) toc = time.time() print(f\u0026#34;Python: numpy version: {1000*(toc-tic):.3f}ms\u0026#34;) # Run it dot_prod_numpy() Python: numpy version: 11.154ms So the \u0026ldquo;vectorised\u0026rdquo; python version is about 330 times faster!\nOf course this is a somewhat unfair comparison, because the NumPy version is actually highly optimised and compiled C code. It\u0026rsquo;s not pretty or concise (and that\u0026rsquo;s coming from someone who chooses to code in C!), but it\u0026rsquo;s fast.\nAn alternative implementation in R I used to write a lot in R, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d dust it off for a comparison.\nSetting our random vectors again\nn \u0026lt;- 10000000 a \u0026lt;- runif(n) b \u0026lt;- runif(n) Naïve loop As with the python case loop over each of the elements\n# Loop tic = Sys.time() result = 0 for (i in 1:length(a)) result = result + a[i] * b[i] toc = Sys.time() cat(\u0026#34;R: loop version: \u0026#34;, round(1000*(toc-tic), 3), \u0026#34;ms\\n\u0026#34;) R: loop version: 533.698 ms Around 7 times faster than the naïve python implementation. Not bad.\nSum the element-wise multiplication An alternative is to use the built-in element-wise multiplication feature and sum up the results\n# Another simplistic approach tic = Sys.time() result = sum(a*b) toc = Sys.time() cat(\u0026#34;R: summing element-wise multiplication version: \u0026#34;, round(1000*(toc-tic), 3), \u0026#34;ms\\n\u0026#34;) R: summing element-wise multiplication version: 1599.384 ms Ouch. This is not what I would have expected using native functions.\nBuilt-in matrix multiplication As R is a language built for mathematical operations, we could just use the built-in matrix multiplication operation.\n# Built in dot product tic = Sys.time() result = a %*% b toc = Sys.time() cat(\u0026#34;R: Base matrix multiplication version: \u0026#34;, round(1000*(toc-tic), 3), \u0026#34;ms\\n\u0026#34;) R: Base matrix multiplication version: 32.981 ms As expected, this looks to have been optimised reasonably well.\nGeometry library How about a library that provides a dot function? It\u0026rsquo;s compiled code so you\u0026rsquo;d expect it to be fast. I saw this suggestion on StackOverflow.\nlibrary(geometry) tic = Sys.time() result = dot(a, b) toc = Sys.time() cat(\u0026#34;R: geometry dot version: \u0026#34;, round(1000*(toc-tic), 3), \u0026#34;ms\\n\u0026#34;) R: geometry dot version: 386.445 ms This is unexpectedly slow.\nLike python, a lot of R\u0026rsquo;s packages aren\u0026rsquo;t actually written in R they\u0026rsquo;re C, C++ and Fortran to get the speed you want.\nCommon lisp implementations How about common lisp?\nSet up our random vector yet again. It\u0026rsquo;s lisp, so let\u0026rsquo;s just use a list.\n(defun randvect (length) \u0026#34;A simple list (length LENTH) of random numbers [0,1)\u0026#34; (loop for i below length collect (random 1.0))) (defparameter n 10000000) (defparameter a (randvect n)) (defparameter b (randvect n)) Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use some of the power of common lisp and write a macro to make generating the timing functions easier. If that sentence doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, this is just a quick way to duplicate the same code across all of my timing functions.\n(defmacro mytime (name description \u0026amp;body body) \u0026#34;Create a function called NAME to get timing when running BODY\u0026#34; `(defun ,name () (let ((tic) (toc)) (setf tic (get-internal-real-time)) ,@body (setf toc (get-internal-real-time)) (format t \u0026#34;lisp: ~a version: ~fms~\u0026amp;\u0026#34; ,description (/ (- toc tic) (/ internal-time-units-per-second 1000)))))) Naïve loop Let\u0026rsquo;s try two different looping approaches.\nv1 One of the simplest data types in lisp is the list, it\u0026rsquo;s not a numerical type like in other languages, it\u0026rsquo;s just a linked list of elements\u0026hellip; v2 Let\u0026rsquo;s test an array object, this would perhaps be preferable? (mytime naive-dot-v1 \u0026#34;naive loop v1\u0026#34; (loop for i in a for j in b sum (* i j))) ;; Let\u0026#39;s make our lists arrays (defparameter aa (make-array (list (length a)) :initial-contents a)) (defparameter ab (make-array (list (length b)) :initial-contents b)) (mytime naïve-dot-v2 \u0026#34;naïve loop v2\u0026#34; (loop for i below (length aa) sum (* (aref aa i) (aref ab i)))) (naive-dot-v1) (naïve-dot-v2) lisp: naive loop v1 version: 163.385ms lisp: naïve loop v2 version: 270.050ms Slower than the best python and R implementations, but not bad for a first pass approach for a non-numerical language.\nMagicl library We can optimise pure lisp, to make it fast\u0026hellip;\n(defparameter ma (magicl:from-list a (list n))) (defparameter mb (magicl:from-list b (list n))) (mytime magicl-dot \u0026#34;magicl pure lisp\u0026#34; (magicl:dot ma mb)) (magicl-dot) lisp: magicl pure lisp version: 11.042ms Ever so slightly slower than the NumPy version (\u0026lt; 1 ms), but not bad at all for pure lisp.\nSo, what does \u0026ldquo;optimised\u0026rdquo; pure lisp look like? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s for another write up on Making (pure) lisp functions faster . I\u0026rsquo;ve put quotes around optimised as this isn\u0026rsquo;t a fancy algorithm, it\u0026rsquo;s simply putting variable type hints in the code. The implementation I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss is a little bit of a cheat compared to MAGICL; I haven\u0026rsquo;t generalised it to work for complex numbers - unlike the MAGICL implementation.\nWhat I will do in this post is share the result\u0026hellip;\nlisp: array-dot-lisp version: 10.576ms Python vs. R vs. lisp - timing What does the following table show us? Python (NumPy), R and common lisp can all produce code that is comparably fast, but in each case you need to think a little bit about your problem set and choose the right approach.\nThe other take-away that I think is important is that (for my use case!) it appears to take considerably less effort and development skill - and is less bug-prone - to take a rapid prototype in lisp and convert it to a fast, production ready implementation than it would in python and R.\nLanguage Implementation Time (ms) Rel. to numpy lisp Pure lisp 10.576 0.9 Python Numpy 11.154 1.0 lisp Magicl pure lisp 11.042 1.0 R Matrix multiplication 32.981 3.0 lisp Naïve loop (v1) 163.385 14.6 lisp Naïve loop (v2) 270.050 24.2 R Geometry library 386.445 34.6 R Naïve loop 533.698 47.8 R Sum element product 1599.384 143.4 Python Naïve loop 3632.499 325.7 The computer was a Early 2015 MacBook Air, 2.2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7 with 8 GB of memory.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t intended as a pun, but I\u0026rsquo;ll take it!\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/code/calculating-a-dot-product/","summary":"You can get high speed, numerical calculation output without having to resort to bug-prone, highly tuned and optimised, unreadable code.","title":"Calculating a DOT product"},{"content":"I have simple rules for meetings.\nMeeting or an email/instant message? Attending meetings is NOT work. You attend meetings to be involved in a discussion. If you don\u0026rsquo;t need to say anything, or write notes, then you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there.\nIf you really must invite everyone, differentiate between required and optional invitees so the group knows who is a decision maker and who is there to observe.\nTry to only invite the people who need to be there. Share minutes, packs, etc. with interested parties.\nNo agenda? Don\u0026rsquo;t attend Show some respect for the people you are inviting to a meeting - let them know what the meeting is about by using an agenda.\nBe prescriptive.\nWhat does this agenda even mean?\nPlease join the XYZ team for a monthly connection session where we will cover all things ABC and XYZ.\nAre we talking business strategy, or what biscuits we should be buying? If I have a conflicting commitment how can I assess which one to attend?\nWhat about this meeting invitation I received:\nTitle: Stewart \u0026amp; XYZ - Data\nAgenda: Sorry to keep changing the date\nIt was clearly a little important to the person, they kept changing the date - clearly not very important as they let other meetings book over the top of an existing one - but why do I care about it? What do I need to do?\nCheck my calendar Again, this is about respect. Check my calendar. Try to find a free slot. Don\u0026rsquo;t just book the first time that works for you.\nPeople are reasonable, if you can\u0026rsquo;t find a slot that works, reach out to the person and explain your difficulty. Most people will suggest a time or reschedule things.\nPre-reading? Equivalently, don\u0026rsquo;t assume people have hours of free time to read your pack before attending a meeting.\nI rather like the Amazon approach to meetings. Most meetings won\u0026rsquo;t follow this approach. However, here\u0026rsquo;s a small step in the right direction:\nIf there is something important for people to read and digest, give them time in your meeting. That way you will know everyone has the same knowledge when it comes to contributing.\nTiming Start your meeting on time. Finish it early. A number of tools now let you default to 20/45 minute meetings rather than the full 30/60 minutes.\nThis is not a new concept, but sadly it needs reinforcing.\nMinutes and actions Get someone to take minutes. Understand the point of taking minutes - it\u0026rsquo;s not to capture what everyone said, it\u0026rsquo;s to capture the consensus.\nCapture action items. If there are no actions that are coming from the meeting then you should have just sent an informative message.\nSend the minutes and actions to attendees and interested parties.\nReality check Like with most things in life, it\u0026rsquo;s never that simple.\nMy teams know that I will support them by declining (with a polite explanation) meetings that don\u0026rsquo;t have an agenda. They also know there are exceptions. It\u0026rsquo;s about being reasonable - a critical meeting; if anyone above them in the organisational structure: i.e. me (I occasionally break my own rules), the CEO, (actually any of the C-Suite); others of their choosing - organises a meeting without an agenda, they need to attend.\nWhen I do it, they\u0026rsquo;re encouraged to poke the bear and remind me to send an agenda.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/meetings-and-agendas/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have simple rules for meetings.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Meetings and agendas"},{"content":"I was doing some mentoring this past weekend and staff issues came up - as they always do.\nI asked about 1:1s and I realised that this person was being a manager, rather than a leader. We started talking and I thought I would share some of the insights that I got from our conversation.\nRules were meant to be broken Do what works for you and your staff. Learn from them. Learn from yourself.\nTreat your staff the way you want to be treated Look at your best and worst experiences. Do more of the good and less of the bad. Be brutally honest with yourself. Was it a bad experience because it was a painful, but useful lesson, or was your manager just bad at their job?\n1:1s aren\u0026rsquo;t a nice to have - they are required, at least for you to offer them If you\u0026rsquo;re not having regular 1:1s with your staff, start as soon as you can. Expect the same of any people leaders reporting to you.\nSchedule enough time When I have a reasonable sized team I book a 30 min slot each fortnight (that\u0026rsquo;s every two weeks for our American friends!) with my staff. I then block out the next 30 minutes so they don\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed. Yes, that is 1 hour for each of your direct reports.\nMake time for people who aren\u0026rsquo;t your direct reports. Some people call them \u0026ldquo;Office hours\u0026rdquo;, whatever you call it, schedule the time and then make time for your people.\nThe times are sacrosanct. Don\u0026rsquo;t reschedule on your staff. This is one of the most important rules. You are making yourself available for your staff and showing them that they are important. Don\u0026rsquo;t accept conflicting meetings. Set this rule early and stick to it and your colleagues will understand. If your staff needs to reschedule, be as flexible as you can. Sometimes you will have to reschedule, apologies, explain and most of time time they will understand.\nThis is not a management meeting, this is their time Another important rule. If you are a people leader you should know on what your staff are working. 1:1s are NOT yet-another work meeting.\nThe 1:1 is for your staff to discuss what is important to them. I\u0026rsquo;ve had staff cry, I\u0026rsquo;ve had staff come out, discuss mental health issues, upcoming sports events, ask me what I thought about business strategy, discuss job offers from competitors. It\u0026rsquo;s all on the table. Don\u0026rsquo;t drive the meeting. Let your staff be comfortable. It might take some time, but trust them.\n1:1s are confidential What you discuss in the 1:1 is between you and the staff member. You have to work with this person for a third of your work week. They need to be able to vent about other people at work. You might listen. You might have coping strategies. You don\u0026rsquo;t, EVER, use this against them.\n1:1s are good for feedback As in the point above, as 1:1s are confidential, you can use them for constructive feedback. Help the person grow in their role. If you want to discuss something that wasn\u0026rsquo;t right, don\u0026rsquo;t blame. Discuss what you saw, how it impacted others and then try to get the person to discuss their actions. Talking objectively allows us to see our actions with a cool head.\nTake feedback Ask each of your staff if the format is working for them, and what they would change. I had one staff member that we went for a walk and a coffee, another just wanted to be in the office, get the meeting done and then back to the day. Some like meetings early in the day, some like them later. Some want shorter meetings (keep the full hour blocked - you might even get some time for yourself!).

In interpreted languages, like python and R there is the concept of removing or deleting a variable or function.\nIn python you del variable, in R you rm(variable):\nfoo = 5 foo Naturally results in\n5 Now we delete the variable:\ndel foo # Delete foo foo # Traceback (most recent call last): # File \u0026#34;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; # NameError: name \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; is not defined Why does common lisp appear to make it more complicated? Why do we use makunbound and fmakunbound, etc., in common lisp?\n(The following is lightly rewritten and sourced from Peter Norvig\u0026rsquo;s Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming)\n…because common Lisp has at least seven name spaces. The two we think of most often are\nFunctions and Macros Variables Python, R, Scheme, etc. conflate these two name spaces, but Common Lisp keeps them separate, so that in a function application like (f) the function/macro name space is consulted for the value of f, but in (+ f), f is treated as a variable name.\nSpecial variables form a distinct name space from lexical variables So the f in (+ f) is treated as either a special or lexical variable, depending on if there is an applicable special declaration. Data types Even if f is defined as a function and/or a variable, it can also be defined as a data type with defstruct, deftype, or defclass. Labels for go statements within a tagbody Block names for return-from statements within a block Symbols inside a quoted expression are treated as constants, and thus form name space These symbols are often used as keys in user-defined tables, and in a sense each such table defines a new name space. One example is the tag name space, used by catch and throw. Another is the package name space. Just because you can do something, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should It is a good idea to limit each symbol to only one name space. Common Lisp will not be confused if a symbol is used in multiple ways, but the poor human reader probably will be.\nPeter Norvig, Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming 🤣\nWhy do I like the lisp approach? It cuts down on errors.\nWhen collaborating it is easy to clash in your namespaces. You might define the variable two_pi, I might want to define two_pi as a function. My code runs, I merge it. Your code runs, you merge it. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have appropriate testing… 💣💥\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a contrived example, presented in three different programming languages: R, python and (common) lisp.\nHere I define a variable two_pi to be twice the value of \\( \\pi \\), then I define a function to calculate the circumference of a circle and then I define a function (also) called two_pi. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens…\nIn R two_pi \u0026lt;- 2 * pi circumference \u0026lt;- function(r) { cat(\u0026#34;R: The circumference is \u0026#34;, (two_pi * r), \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;) } # We all know pi is actually 3 two_pi \u0026lt;- function() { return(6); } circumference(1) In this case R redefines what is meant by two_pi and the circumference function fails. Why? Because you need to call functions: two_pi()\nError in two_pi * r : non-numeric argument to binary operator In python import math two_pi = 2 * pi def circumference(r): print(f\u0026#34;python: The circumference is {two_pi * r}\u0026#34;) # We all know pi is actually 3 def two_pi(): return 6 circumference(1) Python also redefines what is meant by two_pi and the circumference function fails.\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \u0026#34;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; File \u0026#34;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, line 2, in circumference TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: \u0026#39;function\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;int\u0026#39; In lisp (setf two_pi (* 2 pi)) (defun circumference (r) (format t \u0026#34;cl: The circumference is ~a~\u0026amp;\u0026#34; (* two_pi r))) ;; We all know pi is actually only 3.

If my (or your) hostname doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve, the command ipconfig getifaddr en0 will give the local IP address.\nThis also opens up the site to everyone on the network, so probably not wise to do this on a public WiFi.\nExport the HTML for public consumption hugo --cleanDestinationDir Depending on how I\u0026rsquo;m working I\u0026rsquo;ll either use magit (by preference) in Emacs or just git on the command line to commit the changes and then push to the wider world.\n","permalink":"https://stewart123579.github.io/blog/posts/my-blog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is my blog.
